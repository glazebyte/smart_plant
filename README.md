## ESP32 Device Protocol

The app communicates with your ESP32 device using these BLE characteristics:

### Service UUID
```
0000a000-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb
```

### Characteristics

#### 1. Sensor Data (Notify/Read)
**UUID:** `0000a001-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`
```json
{"t": <timestamp>, "soil": <percentage>, "hum": <RH>, "temp": <celsius>, "bat": <volts>}
```

#### 2. Control (Write)
**UUID:** `0000a002-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`
```json
{"cmd": "trigger", "duration": 30}
{"cmd": "cancel"}
```

#### 3. Schedule (Read/Write)
**UUID:** `0000a003-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`
```json
{"slot": 1, "time": "07:30", "duration": 15, "enabled": 1}
```

#### 4. Logs (Read/Notify)
**UUID:** `0000a004-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`
```json
{"action": "get", "start": 0, "count": 100}
```

#### 5. RTC (Read/Write)
**UUID:** `0000a005-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`
```json
{"epoch": 1700000000}
```

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (3.9.2 or higher)
- Android development environment
- ESP32 device with smart plant firmware

### Build Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd smart_plant
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
flutter pub get
```

3. **Generate model files**
```bash
flutter packages pub run build_runner build
```

4. **Build APK**
```bash

## App Architecture

### State Management
- **Provider Pattern**: Centralized state management using Provider package
- **BleProvider**: Manages Bluetooth connectivity and device communication
- **SensorDataProvider**: Handles sensor data storage and historical tracking

### Key Components
- **BLE Service**: Handles all Bluetooth Low Energy communication
- **Data Models**: JSON serializable models for sensor data, schedules, and logs
- **Theme System**: Consistent green-themed UI with light/dark mode support
- **Modular Screens**: Separate screens for dashboard, control, scheduling, logs, and settings

### Dependencies
- `flutter_blue_plus`: BLE communication
- `provider`: State management
- `fl_chart`: Data visualization
- `shared_preferences`: Local data storage
- `material_design_icons_flutter`: Rich icon set
- `json_annotation`: JSON serialization

## Device Setup

### ESP32 Requirements
Your ESP32 device should implement:
- **Soil moisture sensor** (analog reading)
- **DHT22/DHT11** for temperature and humidity
- **Solenoid valve** for water control
- **RTC module** for time keeping
- **BLE server** with the specified service and characteristics

### Recommended Hardware
- ESP32 development board
- Capacitive soil moisture sensor
- DHT22 temperature/humidity sensor
- 12V solenoid valve with relay
- DS3231 RTC module
- Water pump and tubing
- Power supply (battery + solar panel recommended)

## Usage

1. **Power on your ESP32 device**
2. **Open the Smart Plant Monitor app**
3. **Tap the Bluetooth icon** to scan for devices
4. **Select your device** from the list to connect
5. **Monitor real-time data** on the dashboard
6. **Set up watering schedules** in the Schedule tab
7. **Use manual controls** for immediate watering
